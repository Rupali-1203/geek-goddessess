# How is this project set up
Currently, this project is split into several files to make prototyping easier. Current workflow:
```sh

webscraper.py --> csvDownload.py --> preprocessing.py --> FashionTrends.py
```
```sh
webscraper.py webscrapes pinterest.com for images .
```
```sh
csvDownload.py actually downloads the scraped images which are fed into.
```
```sh
preprocessing.py to perform image preprocessing.
```
```sh
Finally, FashionTrends.py is run to actually train the model and test the model.
```
